# pv Uploader

A simple web interface for uploading images to your pv server.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3002`

## Usage

1. Enter the directory name where you want to upload images
2. Click "Choose images..." and select one or more image files
3. Click "Upload Images"

The app will upload the selected images to your pv at `http://192.168.1.212:3001/upload/[DIRECTORY]`

## Configuration
