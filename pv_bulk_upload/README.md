# pv Bulk Upload Tool

A Node.js command-line tool for bulk uploading photos to pv API with interactive album management.

## Features

- Interactive prompts for album name, photo folder, and date information
- Automatic photo file detection (JPG/JPEG and HEIC/HEIF only)
- Album existence checking with creation prompts
- Month/year tagging for album organization
- Batch upload processing with real-time progress monitoring
- Loop mode for uploading multiple albums in one session
- Support for environment variable configuration

## Installation

1. Navigate to the tool directory:
   ```bash
   cd pv_bulk_upload
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the tool interactively:
```bash
node index.js
```

The tool will:
1. Authenticate once at startup
2. Loop through album uploads until you choose to quit
3. For each album: prompt for name, folder, and date (if creating new)
4. Ask if you want to upload another album after each completion

### Commands

- Enter album name (or type "quit" to exit)
- Enter folder path containing photos
- For new albums: enter month/year in MM/YYYY format
- After each upload: choose to continue or quit

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your settings:

```env
API_BASE_URL=https://vault-api.hbvu.su
USERNAME=your_username
PASSWORD=your_password
BUCKET_NAME=pv
```

Or set environment variables directly:

```bash
export API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-server.com
export USERNAME=your_username
export PASSWORD=your_password
export BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket
```

### Supported File Types

The tool automatically detects and uploads only these photo formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- HEIC/HEIF

Other formats (PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, MOV, etc.) are ignored.

### Album Name Capitalization

The tool automatically converts album names to ALL UPPERCASE for consistency.

### Album Date Information

When creating a new album, you'll be prompted to enter the month/year in MM/YYYY format (e.g. 05/2024). This date information is sent to the server for album organization.
